# Use Cases

# Definitions

**Progress tracker** is a component within the German chat interface that monitors, records, and displays a user's progress through users messages and task completion.

**Learning State** refers to the current status of a user's progress in the curriculum determined by their interactions with the app. It is updated dynamically based on user actions such as sending messages, completing tasks. It consists of already learned topics defined in the curriculum with the sccores for each topic. 

**Curriculum** is organized in a graph structure, where each node represents a specific learning objective or topic, and edges between nodes indicate prerequisite relationships. Each node has other metadata such as type (e.g. Grammar or Vocabulary).
